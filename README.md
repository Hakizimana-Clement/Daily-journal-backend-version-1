# Daily-journal-backend

## Hello There âœ‹
Welcome to Daily-journal-backend, a project built with node.js, express.js and mongoose as backend. This project is still under development, but when itâ€™s done, it will let you create and publish your own blog on the home page. You will also need to create an account and log in to post your blog.

But hey, you can test it out right now! Just go to https://dailly-journal.onrender.com/compose and you will be taken to the compose page where you can write your text and see it appear on the home page.

This is just a sneak peek of whatâ€™s coming. Stay tuned for the final productâ€¦ðŸ¤—
